# Feature Specification: DNS Performance Benchmarking Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-dns-web-app`
**Created**: 2024-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Transform existing CLI DNS benchmarking tool into modern web application with real-time testing, interactive visualizations, and cross-platform accessibility

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Network administrators and developers need to quickly identify the fastest DNS servers for their location and use case. They visit the web application, see their current DNS configuration automatically detected, start a benchmark test, watch real-time progress as domains are tested against multiple DNS providers, and receive clear recommendations with performance data to make informed DNS configuration decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user visits the web application, **When** page loads, **Then** current DNS servers are automatically detected and displayed with current response times
2. **Given** user clicks "Quick Test" button, **When** benchmark starts, **Then** real-time progress shows testing 3 public DNS providers plus current DNS with live response times
3. **Given** benchmark is running, **When** user watches progress, **Then** activity log shows individual domain query results and current test status updates in real-time
4. **Given** benchmark completes, **When** results display, **Then** DNS servers are ranked by performance with clear winner and actionable recommendations
5. **Given** user wants detailed analysis, **When** viewing results page, **Then** interactive charts show response time comparisons and success rate analytics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no DNS servers can be auto-detected from the system?
- How does system handle DNS servers that timeout or fail completely?
- What occurs when user cancels a benchmark mid-execution?
- How does the application behave with slow or unstable internet connections?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically detect current DNS servers from browser's network configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate DNS server IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) before testing
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to start Quick Test (top 3 providers + current) or Full Test (all public providers)
- **FR-004**: System MUST test DNS response times against 20+ diverse domains concurrently
- **FR-005**: Users MUST see real-time progress updates during benchmark execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide WebSocket-based live updates with <100ms latency
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to cancel running benchmarks at any time
- **FR-008**: System MUST display results with performance rankings and improvement recommendations
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to export benchmark results in CSV and JSON formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST store benchmark history for comparison over time
- **FR-011**: Application MUST work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to configure custom DNS servers for testing
- **FR-014**: System MUST show statistical analysis (avg, min, max, median response times)
- **FR-015**: System MUST indicate DNS server reliability with success rate percentages

### Key Entities
- **DNS Server**: Represents a DNS resolver with IP address, name, type (current/public/custom), and performance metrics
- **Benchmark Test**: Contains configuration, progress state, start/end times, and aggregated results
- **Domain Test Result**: Individual query result with domain name, DNS server, response time, and success status
- **Test Configuration**: User-selected options including server list, test type, and domain set
