## Executive Vision

Transform DNS Bench Web from a specialized DNS benchmarking tool into a comprehensive, portable "Swiss Army Knife" for network engineers and IT professionals. The goal is to create a single, self-contained executable that provides enterprise-grade network diagnostics, troubleshooting, and analysis capabilities that can be deployed instantly from a USB drive or copied to any Windows/Linux system.

## Strategic Objectives

### 1. **Ultimate Portability**
- **Single Executable**: Deploy as standalone binary requiring zero external dependencies
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows (.exe) and Linux (binary)
- **USB-Ready**: Copy-and-run capability from portable media
- **Size Target**: <200MB total package including all tools and documentation

### 2. **Comprehensive Network Diagnostics**
- **DNS Analysis**: Advanced DNS testing, DNSSEC validation, zone transfers
- **Connectivity Testing**: Multi-target ping, traceroute, MTU discovery
- **Protocol Analysis**: TCP/UDP testing, HTTP/HTTPS validation, SSL certificate checks
- **Network Discovery**: Subnet scanning, device enumeration, service identification
- **Performance Testing**: Bandwidth measurement, latency analysis, jitter detection

### 3. **Professional Reporting**
- **Executive Summaries**: High-level network health reports for management
- **Technical Details**: In-depth diagnostic data for engineers
- **Export Capabilities**: PDF reports, CSV data, JSON for integration
- **Historical Trending**: Track network performance over time
- **Comparative Analysis**: Before/after testing, multi-site comparisons
